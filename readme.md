# Networked EV Adoption Model

This repository contains a network-based model of electric vehicle (EV) adoption developed for Assignment 3. EV adoption is modelled as a coordination problem, where individual decisions depend on social influence and infrastructure feedback.

The analysis examines baseline dynamics, the role of network structure, and the effectiveness of targeted policy interventions (seeding early adopters). Results highlight tipping points, strong path dependence, and the importance of early, targeted interventions, especially in clustered social networks.

The code and simulations are intended to provide qualitative policy insights rather than quantitative forecasts.
